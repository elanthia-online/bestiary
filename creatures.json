    "description": "A transparent, flickering, light-grey canine, the ghost wolf is the captured spirit of a member of the wolf packs that used to roam the lands.  The ghost wolf uses its snapping jaws and rending claws to best advantage.  As it did in life, the ghost wolf prefers to hunt with other members of its species, carefully watching its prey through bright yellow eyes, darting in to bite, then rushing away while another ghost wolf attacks from the rear."

Ragged robes lift and swirl about her like animated tendrils, and bare bones protrude from similar tatters of skin hanging from her hands and hollow cheeks.

As she circles, constantly whispering a litany of magic, gooey pools of darkness which were once the horror's eyes weep rivulets of stain down the remnants of her face."

Her face is a vision of beauty.  However, darkness fills her features like a secret biding in her glance, lending her visage an indistinct appearance.  Her eyes are dark and wide, framed with fringes of long lashes, and in the depths of those expressive wells there flickers highlights of energy.  Or perhaps they are coals of hatred waiting to be unearthed.  The witch's hands move constantly, her long fingers and elegant nails making constant motions as if they have manic agendas of their own."

Massing more than ten giantmen, it is a a mountain of rock when in motion and very little, man or animal can oppose its desired path of travel once it is in motion."
