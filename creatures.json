Giant Veabas will attack with a very simple <a href=\"/Attack_strength\" title=\"Attack strength\">AS</a> based bite or claw attack 99 times out of 100. The only twist thrown into the mix is a very rarely used, however quite dangerous charging attack. In this attack, the veaba rams its torso into the victim, and heaves them through the air into an adjacent room. This in and of itself prones the target, inflicts some <a href=\"/RT\" title=\"RT\" class=\"mw-redirect\">RT</a>, often ranging from 10 to 20 seconds, and causes an impact wound which is more often than not a rank 2 or 3 wound, with a heavy stun. This maneuver could potentially be immediately fatal, should the injury site be susceptible to crit deaths. This attack is fairly hard to dodge, has no warning, and almost always will turn a winning battle into a precarious situation. Assuming the victim does dodge, this will still inflict a base 3 RT as the character moves out of the way. Fortunately, if the attack does succeed, it is rare for the veaba to follow you into the new room and finish the job, although it does occur. This can also be an issue if another veaba or cave lizard is present in the resulting room. This maneuver however, is the only real threat the veaba has to offer, and uses it very rarely. \n</p>",
