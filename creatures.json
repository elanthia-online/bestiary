Giant Veabas will attack with a very simple AS based bite or claw attack 99 times out of 100. The only twist thrown into the mix is a very rarely used, however quite dangerous charging attack. In this attack, the veaba rams its torso into the victim, and heaves them through the air into an adjacent room. This in and of itself prones the target, inflicts some RT, often ranging from 10 to 20 seconds, and causes an impact wound which is more often than not a rank 2 or 3 wound, with a heavy stun. This maneuver could potentially be immediately fatal, should the injury site be susceptible to crit deaths. This attack is fairly hard to dodge, has no warning, and almost always will turn a winning battle into a precarious situation. Assuming the victim does dodge, this will still inflict a base 3 RT as the character moves out of the way. Fortunately, if the attack does succeed, it is rare for the veaba to follow you into the new room and finish the job, although it does occur. This can also be an issue if another veaba or cave lizard is present in the resulting room. This maneuver however, is the only real threat the veaba has to offer, and uses it very rarely. ",

This will prone the victim, and can cause up to 20 RT, but it can also cause as little as 3 RT, and is often easily avoided, even by pures.

It is different from its lesser-ranked brethren in two respects, however.  First, there is a glimmer of intelligence in its small, close-set, pink eyes.  Second, two long, inflamed scars run from its chest, down its forearms, to end at its elbows.  These signify the testing the troll shamans have put the troll chieftain through to ensure it is qualified for its rank.  It is rumored that no one ever again sees those that do not qualify.",

His hands clench and unclench, causing the muscles in his hirsute arms to ripple powerfully.

Especially in the treetop portion of the forest, they will often be present for only a short period of time before they gate into the much larger ground level portion of the forest. Additionally, both rogues and wizards tend to spawn in groups. One will often encounter multiple ogre wizards in a row, and then no more for the entirety of a hunt. This can be particularly difficult when attempting to combat a grizzled ogre that is a wizard. If not dealt with promptly, it will likely gate to another portion of the forest, requiring a great deal of searching to find it."

They cast frequently, and many of their spells, such as Dark Catalyst (719) and the itchy Curse (715) can be extremely dangerous even on minor endrolls. With this in mind, preventing casting through the use of Silence (210), Corrupt Essence (703), stuns, or disabling maneuvers is a must. They have a very wide array of spells, so expect anything if they manage to cast a spell. They have no maneuvers to speak of other than spells such as Quake (709) and Energy Maelstrom (710). Their CS is fairly high, so even against a like leveled, fully spelled up pure, they may have a small warding margin. They do not spawn with a prepared spell, nor do they prepare spells while wandering or spell themselves up. However, their TD is relatively high compared to the other denizens of the Labyrinth. If their casting can be prevented, they offer little risk on their own."
